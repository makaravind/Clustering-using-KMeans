# Clustering-using-KMeans

Simple KMeans algorithm is implemented in Java to cluster n number of 2-D data points into k number of clusters


# GUIDE

1) Starting point of the program is App class.
2) There are few data points by default you can add as many as possible.
3) The program terminates when it reachs max iterations.
4) By default the max iterations is 50.
5) ClusterHandler handles all the clusters.
6) clusterify() is the method to cluster the points.
7) prettyPrintClusters() is used to print the clusters on to the console.
